## Vulnerability Scanning Overview

Vulnerability testing builds on recon by actively probing systems for **known weaknesses**, misconfigurations, and outdated software. Results should always be validated manually to reduce false positives.


## Nmap – Service & Vulnerability Enumeration

```bash
nmap -sC -sV -O -Pn example.com
```

* `-sC` → default NSE (Nmap Scripting Engine) scripts
* `-sV` → service/version detection
* `-O` → OS fingerprinting
* `-Pn` → skip host discovery (useful behind firewalls)

### Vulnerability Scripts

```bash
nmap --script vuln example.com
```

* Runs community-maintained NSE vulnerability checks
* High signal, but not exhaustive

---

## SearchSploit – Exploit Intelligence Mapping

SearchSploit maps discovered software versions to **publicly known vulnerabilities** from Exploit-DB.

```bash
searchsploit apache 2.4
```

```bash
searchsploit --nmap scan.xml
```

* Links recon output to known CVEs and PoCs
* Does **not** confirm exploitability—manual analysis required

Local exploit database update:

```bash
searchsploit -u
```

## Nessus – Authenticated Vulnerability Scanning

Nessus performs deep vulnerability assessment using plugin-based checks.

### Installation (Debian / Ubuntu)

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install ./Nessus-*.deb
```

Start the service:

```bash
sudo systemctl start nessusd
```

Access UI:

```text
https://localhost:8834
```

* Initial setup requires account activation
* Use **authenticated scans** where possible for accuracy

---

### Importing Scan Targets & Results

Nessus supports importing external discovery data.

#### Import Nmap Scan

```bash
nmap -oX scan.xml example.com
```

Upload `scan.xml` via:

* **Nessus → Scans → Import**

Benefits:

* Faster scanning
* Reduces network noise
* Improves host/service accuracy

## WMAP – Web Vulnerability Scanner (Metasploit)

WMAP integrates web vulnerability checks into Metasploit.

```bash
msfconsole
```

```text
load wmap
```

Add target:

```text
wmap_sites -a http://example.com
```

Run scans:

```text
wmap_run -t
```

* Focused on web app misconfigurations and exposures
* Best used after manual web recon

---

## DAVTest – WebDAV Misconfiguration Testing

Tests for **WebDAV upload and execution weaknesses**.

```bash
davtest -url http://example.com
```

* Checks PUT, MOVE, DELETE permissions
* Identifies dangerous file handling behavior
* Common on legacy or misconfigured servers

---

## Cadaver – WebDAV Manual Interaction

Interactive WebDAV client for validation.

```bash
cadaver http://example.com
```

Example actions:

```text
ls
put test.txt
get index.html
```

* Used to **confirm** DAVTest findings
* Valuable for controlled validation, not automation

---

## Nessus + Nmap + SearchSploit Workflow

1. **Nmap** → discover services and versions
2. **Nessus** → identify known vulnerabilities and misconfigs
3. **SearchSploit** → research historical exploit context
4. **Manual validation** → confirm real-world impact

---

## Reporting & Risk Context

* CVE presence ≠ exploitability
* Prioritize:

  * Internet-facing services
  * Authentication bypass
  * Remote code execution
* Always correlate with:

  * Patch level
  * Configuration
  * Network exposure
