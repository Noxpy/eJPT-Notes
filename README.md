# eJPT v2 – Study Notes & Reference Repository

## Repository Overview

This repository serves as an informal but structured **study companion** for the **eJPT v2 (eLearnSecurity Junior Penetration Tester)** certification.

Its purpose is to consolidate concepts, methodologies, and practical commands covered in the official **INE PTSv2 learning path** into a single, easily navigable reference. These notes are designed to support:

- exam preparation,
- hands-on lab work,
- and long-term retention through personal annotation.

This repository is **not a replacement** for official INE courseware or labs. Instead, it works best when used *alongside* the PTSv2 course material, official documentation, and active lab practice.

The primary goal is **clarity**: understanding what you are expected to identify, enumerate, exploit, and report during a real-world–style penetration test, as reflected in the eJPT exam design.

## Exam Objectives

The eJPT v2 exam evaluates your ability to perform practical penetration testing tasks, including:

- Locating endpoints within a network  
- Identifying open ports and running services  
- Determining the operating system of a target  
- Extracting company and user information from public sources  
- Gathering technical information via passive and active reconnaissance  
- Enumerating network, system, and user information from targets  
- Identifying vulnerabilities and assessing their impact  
- Transferring files to and from compromised systems  
- Extracting hash and password information  
- Identifying, modifying, and using public exploits  
- Conducting exploitation using Metasploit  
- Performing pivoting via routing and port forwarding  
- Conducting brute-force password attacks and hash cracking  
- Identifying and exploiting web application vulnerabilities  
- Locating hidden files and directories  
- Conducting web application reconnaissance

## Learning Path Context (PTSv2)

These notes are primarily aligned with the **Penetration Testing Student v2 (PTSv2)** learning path.

PTSv2 is designed to:

- cover prerequisite topics in **information security, networking, programming, and penetration testing**,
- prepare candidates for the **eJPT certification exam**,
- provide foundational skills suitable for **entry-level penetration testing roles**.

### Course Scope

Approximate duration: **~145 hours total**

- ~56 hours of video content  
- 229 videos  
- 154 quizzes  
- 120 hands-on labs  

### Major Topic Areas

- **Assessment Methodologies & Auditing**  
  ~27 hours total (~11 hours video)

- **Host & Network Penetration Testing**  
  ~108 hours total (~42 hours video)

- **Web Application Penetration Testing**  
  ~10 hours total (~3 hours video)

## Practical Training Approach

For hands-on practice:

- Primary lab work is performed using the **INE Labs Environment** provided with the PTSv2 course.
- Additional references may link to **Attack-Defense by PentesterAcademy** (subscription required) and are used strictly as supplementary practice.

These notes originally began during study for **PTS v1** (now discontinued). Relevant prerequisite and foundational material has been retained where it remains applicable to PTSv2 and eJPT.

## Exam Philosophy

From a technical perspective, the eJPT exam simulates a **black-box penetration test**:

- minimal initial information about the target network,
- browser-based labs (no VPN required),
- unrestricted access to the lab environment for the full exam duration,
- a provided Letter of Engagement,
- hands-on, open-book format,
- dynamic, randomly generated flags.

The exam evaluates your ability to **find answers**, not follow a rigid path. Tooling, methodology, and workflow decisions are intentionally left to the candidate.

Before attempting the exam:
- 📖 Read the **Letter of Engagement**
- 📖 Review the **Lab Guidelines**
- 🔍 Explore multiple learning resources in addition to the official **INE eJPT course**

## Disclaimer

This repository is intended solely as a **supplementary study aid**.

- It does not replace official INE courseware, labs, or documentation.
- Commands, techniques, and examples are provided for educational purposes and may require adaptation depending on context.
- If a command or technique does not behave as expected, consult official documentation or authoritative sources for clarification.

Use these notes to reinforce understanding, not as a shortcut. The eJPT is designed to test practical reasoning, methodology, and adaptability.

These notes reflect my own learning process while preparing for the eJPT and working through the PTSv2 material. They are shared in the spirit of structured learning, curiosity, and practical skill-building.

Study actively, break things thoughtfully, and always understand *why* something works — not just *that* it works. Feel free to Fork!
